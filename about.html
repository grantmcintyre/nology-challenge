                        <p class = "text-in-card">Whilst I have enjoyed enormously some of the experiences a career in the arts has afforded me, I have had reservations about how much longer I want to stay in the field. The Coronavirus pandemic put an end to my last contract in March and the lockdown period has given me an abundance of time to really act (no pun intended) on these reservations and to look into what else is out there.<br>
                            <br>Whilst of course Technology as an industry was affected like most were by the onset of the pandemic, it is evident that it is one that will continue to go from strength to strength even in what will be perilous times for many other industries and businesses. _nology seems like the perfect bridge from one career into another and the first steps on the ladder of a hopefully very exciting and multifaceted career in technology. </p>

                        <p class = "text-in-card">I was born in Stirling, Scotland in January 1993. 4 years later due to my Father's career taking him to England we moved to and settled in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, where I am now back living today.</p>

                        <p class = "text-in-card">After growing up and attending school in North Yorkshire I attended The Guildford School of Acting in Surrey and trained in becoming an actor. Graduating in 2015, I have been fortunate enough to have carved out a career for myself in what is a very daunting and competitive industry and have performed on some of the country's most famous stages such as The Royal Albert Hall and The Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London plus multiple flagship theatres and arenas all over the UK and Ireland. This line of work has also taken me all over the world in a Guest Entertainer capacity on Celebrity and Norwegian  Cruise ships, from nearby in Europe to as far as Dunedin on the South Island of New Zealand, taking in Asia, The Pacific Islands and Australia along the way.</p>

                        <p class = "text-in-card">As much as I have artistic interests my main source of interest and enjoyment comes in the form of sport. I played football competitively from a young age to a good standard until I ventured south to train and I also am a golf fanatic. While sadly I barely play anything like the amount of football now that I would like to, I am a big Glasgow Celtic supporter and still play regular golf at my home course.</p>
